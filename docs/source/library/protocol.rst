Light model library
===================

The component ships with predefined light measurements for some light models.
This library will keep extending by the effort of community users.

These models are located in `config/custom_components/powercalc/data` directory.
You can also define your own models in `config/powercalc-custom-models` directory, when a manufacturer/model exists in this directory this will take precedence over the default data directory.

Each light model has it's own subdirectory `{manufacturer}/{modelid}`. i.e. signify/LCT010

model.json
----------

Every model MUST contain a ``model.json`` file which defines the supported calculation modes and other configuration.
See the `json schema <https://github.com/bramstroker/homeassistant-powercalc/blob/master/custom_components/powercalc/data/model_schema.json>`_ how the file must be structured or the examples below.

When the calculation strategy is ``lut`` also [CSV lookup files](#lut-data-files) must be provided, which can be created by running the measure tool.

Example lut mode:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "Hue White and Color Ambiance A19 E26 (Gen 5)",
        "standby_power": 0.4,
        "calculation_strategy": "lut",
        "measure_method": "script",
        "measure_device": "Shelly Plug S"
    }

Example linear mode

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "Hue Go",
        "calculation_strategy": "linear",
        "standby_power": 0.2,
        "linear_config": {
            "min_power": 0,
            "max_power": 6
        },
        "measure_method": "manual",
        "measure_device": "From manufacturer specifications"
    }

LUT data files
--------------

To calculate power consumption a lookup is done into CSV data files.

Depending on the supported color modes of the light the integration expects one or more CSV files here:

 - hs.csv.gz (hue/saturation, colored lamps)
 - color_temp.csv.gz (color temperature)
 - brightness.csv.gz (brightness only lights)

Some lights support two color modes (both hs and color_temp), so there must be two CSV files.

The files are gzipped to keep the repository footprint small, and installation fast but gzipping files is not mandatory.

Example:

.. code-block::

    - signify
      - LCT010
        - model.json
        - hs.csv.gz
        - color_temp.csv.gz

Expected file structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The file **MUST** contain a header row.
- Watt value decimal point must be a `.` not a `,`. i.e. `18.4`
- The data rows in the CSV files **MUST** have the following column order:

**hs.csv**

.. code-block:: text

    bri,hue,sat,watt

**color_temp.csv**

.. code-block:: text

    bri,mired,watt

**brightness.csv**

.. code-block:: text

    bri,watt

***Ranges***:

- brightness (0-255)
- hue (0-65535)
- saturation (0-255)
- mired (0-500)  min value depending on min mired value of the light model
